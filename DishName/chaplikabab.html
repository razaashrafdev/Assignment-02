    <h1>CHAPLI KABAB</h1>

        <ul>
            Outwardly crispy yet soft once bitten into, chapli kababs are a signature dish of Pashtun cuisine.
             Originally from Peshawar in northern Pakistan (hence the alternate name peshawari kabab), they’re a popular street food in South Asian countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.

            Chapli kababs are flavorful patties made from minced meat (usually beef, mutton, or chicken) seasoned with a blend of coarsely ground herbs and spices like anardana (dried pomegranate seeds), coriander leaves, chili powder, and cumin.
             They’re shaped into patties before being shallow- or deep-fried in ghee (Indian clarified butter) or tallow (animal fat).

            After cooking, this specialty of Pashtun cuisine can be served with various chutneys and yogurt and is often enjoyed with a side of rice or naan, or eaten like a sandwich (bun kebab).

    <h1>HALVA PURI</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            In the midst of all the bread and rice dishes that have been listed in this Pakistani food guide, halwa puri (or halwa poori) is a stand-out.
             This sweet dish has two main components – semolina pudding and fried flatbread.
             It’s typically eaten for breakfast though it can also be served during religious festivities.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            With just the right amounts of sugar and milk, the semolina pudding is delectably soft and creamy.
             Nuts like pistachio and almonds are optional but they can be included to impart texture to the dish.
        </ul>

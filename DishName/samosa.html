        <ul>
            Stuffed to the brim with savory fillings, samosas make for a great appetizer or snack.
         It’s an especially popular food during the month of Ramadan when it’s eaten at the end of the day to break the daily fast, otherwise known as iftar.

            The dish is typically made with potatoes, peas, and ground meat – usually lamb, beef, or chicken.
             Whether triangular or cone-shaped, the pastry is meant to have a nice, crispy. <br />

            Samosas are highly popular in many countries throughout Asia and Africa like Pakistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and Ethiopia.
 It’s an extremely versatile dish that exists in many different versions throughout Pakistan.<br />

            In the eastern and southern regions of the country, samosas tend to be spicier and contain mostly potato or vegetable fillings.
 In the western and northern parts of Pakistan, they’re less spicy and more often made with minced meat fillings.<br />

            As such, samosas are a good example of why Pakistani cuisine is known to be culturally diverse.
             No matter the form, they’re best enjoyed with a side of tasty green chutney.

    <h1>SEEKH KABAB</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Seekh kebab literally means “skewered meat cooked over fire”.
             In spite of its rather uninspiring name, it’s the kind of dish that’s guaranteed to exceed your expectations.
             After all, it’s hard to be disappointed by a grilled meat dish that promises fatty juiciness, a dash of heat, and a distinctly smoky flavor!

            Indian-style seekh kebabs are typically made from ground lamb or chicken but the Pakistani version is most often made with beef.
             The minced beef is seasoned with garlic, onions, ginger, green chili peppers, spices, and herbs before being shaped into logs, skewered, and then grilled.

            While seekh kebabs can be baked in an oven or pan-fried, they’re best when grilled or cooked over an open fire.

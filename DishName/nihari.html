    <h1>NIHARI : </h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Though nihari is mostly known as a traditional food that originated from the Indian subcontinent, its prominence in Pakistani cuisine can’t be overstated.
             Given how frequently it’s served in the country’s most populous cities, this tasty main dish strikes a balance between nourishing and appetizing.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Nihari is composed of tender beef shanks that sit in a stew thickened by durum whole wheat flour (atta).
             This Pakistani beef stew is delicious any which way but the most decadent versions are made with buttery bone marrow seeped into the stew.

    <h1>CHICKEN KARAHI</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Chicken karahi gets its name from the wok-like, cast-iron pan it was originally cooked in.
             It’s one of the most popular types of Pakistani curry and is said to have originated from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of the country.

            Karahi is known for its fragrant base made from fresh ginger, tomatoes, and garlic.
             Though modern recipes often include onions, the most traditional versions of chicken karahi are made without them.

            Chicken is arguably the most popular but it’s worth noting that karahi can be made with other types of meat as well like lamb, beef, or fish.
             Like many other Pakistani dishes, it’s often topped with green chilies and coriander to amplify its inherently pungent flavors.

            Whether found at Pakistani street restaurants called dhaba or cooked at home, the meal is most complete when served with a choice of basmati rice or naan.

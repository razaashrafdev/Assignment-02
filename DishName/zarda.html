            Zarda is another tantalizingly sweet dessert that Pakistan shares with the rest of the Indian subcontinent.
             Known for its inviting yellow-orange hue, this sweet rice dish is prepared by cooking long-grain rice in clarified butter and then coating them in sugar syrup.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Eaten with an assortment of dry fruits, nuts, and a generous amount of raisins, zarda is an explosion of color and texture.
             It should come as no surprise then that this memorable treat tastes just as lovely as it looks.
        </ul>

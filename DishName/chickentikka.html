    <h1>CHICKEN TIKKA</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            This popular Pakistani dish dons an orange color that’s just as bright as its flavors.
             Though traditionally grilled over hot coals or cooked in a tandoor oven, modern versions can be cooked on top of a stove or baked inside an oven.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Marinated with spices like garam masala, cumin, and turmeric, chicken tikka sports a robust piquant flavor.
             Once nicely charred, it’s served with a spritz of lemon juice, in addition to either a mint or tamarind chutney.
        </ul>

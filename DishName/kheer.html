    <h1>KHEER (Pakistani Rice Pudding)</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Kheer gets its name from the Sanskrit word for “milk”.
             A creamy and sweet dish, this Pakistani rice pudding is commonly served during Eid al Fitr.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Properly made kheer has a consistency that’s neither too runny nor too thick.
             It’s spiced with a variety of fragrant ingredients like cloves, saffron, and nutmeg before being garnished with toppings like cashews, dried fruits, and green cardamom.
        </ul>

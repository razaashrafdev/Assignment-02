            Gulab jamun means “rose water berry” in Hindi.
             Popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, this delicious dessert consists of little fried dough balls traditionally made from khoya.
             The fried dough balls are doused with simple syrup and garnished with almonds or cashews before serving.

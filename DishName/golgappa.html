            In essence, gol gappas are crispy fried hollow balls of dough (puri) loaded with a variety of fillings like boiled potatoes, chopped onions, chickpeas, tamarind paste, and mint chutney.

            What makes gol gappa even more interesting is that each stuffed puri is filled with a spicy-sour liquid before being eaten whole.
             A beloved street food dish, especially among women, it needs to be eaten quickly before the delicate puri crumbles from the liquid.

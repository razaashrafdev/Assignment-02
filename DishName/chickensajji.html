    <h1>CHICKEN SAJJI</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Not all chicken dishes can compare to the most famous meal from Pakistan’s province of Balochistan – sajji!
        </ul>

            Sajji, or Balochi sajji, refers to a style of cooking that entails rubbing a whole chicken with salt, skewering it, and then cooking it over an open fire.
             It’s traditionally made with goat or lamb but in modern times, chicken has become just as popular as well.

            Though chicken sajji is similar to rotisserie chicken in that it’s also skewered and roasted, the meat is uniquely spiced with both chaat and garam masala.
             The chicken is meant to be extra juicy and soft as it’s traditionally cooked over an open fire through the night.

            With a crispy skin that exudes a smoky flavor, chicken sajji is a delectable addition to Pakistan’s rich food culture.

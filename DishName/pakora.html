            Pakora is another classic iftar staple and a popular street food in Pakistan.
             It essentially refers to any type of fritter that’s been coated with a batter of chickpea or gram flour.
             Spices like cumin and turmeric are added to give the deep-fried snack a little kick.
             A perfect batch will have a texture that’s just fluffy enough, and not too flat.

        <ul>
            Though Pakistani cuisine offers many exciting meat dishes, lobia ka salan is a vegan option that will entice even the staunchest carnivores.
             Itâ€™s a Pakistani curry made primarily with black-eyed peas and a base of garlic paste, onions, and tomato sauce.
        </ul>

            The peas give lobia ka salan its nutty flavor while the various spices used to flavor the dish make for an aromatic gustatory experience.
             The stew is often topped with either green chilies or coriander and served hot for the whole family to enjoy.

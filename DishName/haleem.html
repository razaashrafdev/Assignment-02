        <ul>
            Haleem (or daleem) refers to a type of Pakistani stew that’s widely consumed throughout the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
             Originally from Iran, it can be found in different variations in countries like Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Armenia.

            Haleem typically consists of grains, legumes, meat (typically either chicken, lamb, or beef), spices, and a cooking liquid.
             The dish is slow-cooked for several hours until a smooth, paste-like consistency is achieved.
        </ul>

            In Pakistan, haleem is a celebratory dish that’s often reserved for special occasions.
             Sour and tangy in flavor, it can be eaten with a spoon or some type of flatbread like naan bread.

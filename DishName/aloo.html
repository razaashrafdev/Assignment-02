            If you’re in the mood for a hearty Pakistani dish, then look no further than a simple but satisfying bowl of aloo gobi matar.
             Like many comforting Pakistani foods, it’s a meal that reminds people of home.

            Aloo gobi matar is a healthy cauliflower and potato curry that consists mainly of potatoes, cauliflower, and peas.
             The dish can be cooked dry (similar to a plate of steamed vegetables) or served swimming in a spicy sauce.
             Both are delicious but personally, I prefer the latter.

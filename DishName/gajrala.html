        <ul>
            If you’re looking for a dessert that’s both satisfying and healthy, then look no further than gajrela.
             It’s also known as “gajar ka halwa”, with gajar meaning “carrot” in Hindi and halwa being the Arabic word for “sweet”.
        </ul>

            Gajrela is essentially a carrot-based pudding that’s made with an abundance of khoya (dried milk that’s been thickened in an iron pan), sugar, and nuts.
             It’s best enjoyed during winter though it’s also traditionally prepared for religious events.

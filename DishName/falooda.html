            You can’t talk about the best Pakistani desserts without including this summertime delicacy.
             Whether consumed as a beverage or eaten with a spoon, falooda is an ice cream dessert that’s delightfully refreshing and unapologetically sweet.

            Falooda is made with a plethora of ingredients like vermicelli noodles, jellies, and chia or basil seeds soaked in milk.
             Often served with ice cream, its use of rose-flavored sugar syrup acts as a food coloring that gives the dessert its distinct pink hue.
